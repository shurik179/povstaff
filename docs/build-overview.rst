Build overview
==============
The staff consists of the following subassemblies:

* **battery assembly**, containing two batteries, controller board,  wiring, and spacers. This
  assembly is placed in the center of the staff

* two **LED assemblies**, one on each side of the battery assembly. Each LED
  assembly consists  of the wood dowel with two 50cm LED strips on opposite sides
  of the dowel. On inner end of the dowel, there is a power distribution board
  to which both LED strips are connected

* A **power switch** at the outer end of one LED assembly

* a **charging connector**, with 5.5 mm OD/2.1mm ID barrel connector, placed at the outer
  end of the other LED assembly

All of the above are inserted into the **polycarbonate tube** and protected by nylon spacers wrapped in soft foam at both ends. The middle of the tube is wrapped in tennis racket  **grip tape** to provide secure grip.

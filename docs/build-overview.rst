==============
The staff consists of the following subassemblies:

* **battery assembly**, containing two batteries, controller board,  wiring, and spacers. This
  assembly is placed in the center of the staff

* two **LED assemblies**, one on each side of the battery assembly. Each LED
  assembly consists  of the wood dowel with two 50cm LED strips on opposite sides
  of the dowel. On inner end of the dowel, there is a power distribution board (PDB)
  to which both LED strips are connected; on the outer, one assembly has a
  charging connector, and the other, a switch.



All of the above are inserted into the **polycarbonate tube** and protected at both ends
by 3d printed endcaps wrapped in soft foam. The middle of the tube is wrapped
in tennis racket  **grip tape** to provide secure grip.



**Warning**:

1. At some steps you will be using  epoxy. Please be careful that it
   doesn't get on your skin - to be on the safe side, you can  put on thin
   latex  gloves.

2. You will be soldering leads to 18650 Li-Ion battery. It can be dangerous if
   not done right. Make sure to **carefully read the instructions** before doing this. If you
   are not sure you can do it, then this project is not for you.

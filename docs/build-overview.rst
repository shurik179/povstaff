* two **LED assemblies**, one on each side of the battery assembly. Each LED
  assembly consists  of the wood dowel with two 50cm LED strips on opposite sides
  of the dowel. On inner end of the dowel, there is a power distribution board (PDB)
  to which both LED strips are connected; on the outer, one assembly has a
  charging connector, and the other, a switch.



All of the above are inserted into the **polycarbonate tube** and protected at both ends
by 3d printed endcaps wrapped in soft foam. The middle of the tube is wrapped
in tennis racket  **grip tape** to provide secure grip.

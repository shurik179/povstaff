Step 4: Switch connector
========================
Materials and tools:

* Bag C from the kit

* flush cutters, soldering iron

Steps:


1. Take the two-pin wire from bag C. Insert the ends of the wire into holes
   in the switch terminals  as shown below Note: one of the wires
   must be soldered to the **middle** terminal, and the other,
   to one of the other terminals (doesn't matter which one). It doesn't matter
   which of the two wires is soldered to the middle terminal.

2.  Solder the wires. Use flush cutters to trim the protruding end of the wires.

3. Using flush cutters, cut open the plastic retention tabs on both sides of
   the switch as shown below. Note: it is recommended to cut it below the "joint".

4. Insert the switch in the 3d printed spacer as shown below.

5. Take the remaining ("SWITCH") LED assembly, with black PDB.
   Put the 3d printed spacer with the switch  onto the
   other end of the dowel, making sure that the opening in the spacer is on the
   same side of the dowel as the two holes in the PDB.

6. Run the wire along the wood dowel; straighten it to remove twists. Insert the
   tinned ends of the wire into the holes in the PDB. It doesn't matter which
   wire goes into which hole. Solder the wires and use flush cutters to trim the wire ends protruding
   from  on the opposite side of the PDB.

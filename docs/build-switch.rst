Step 4: Switch connector
========================
Materials and tools:

* Bag C from the kit

* flush cutters, soldering iron

Steps:

1. Get the switch from bag C. Use the flush cutters to cut open the two
   retention plastic tabs on the sides of the switch, as shown in the photo below.


2. Take the two-pin wire from bag C. Insert the ends of the wire into holes
   in the switch terminals  as shown below and solder .Note: one of the wires
   must be soldered to the **middle** terminal, and the other,
   to one of the other terminals (doesn't matter which one). It doesn't matter
   which of the two wires is soldered to the middle terminal.

3. Use flush cutters to trim the soldered wires.

4. Insert the switch in the 3d printed spacer as shown below.

5. Take the remaining ("SWITCH") LED assembly, with black PDB.
   Put the 3d printed spacer with the switch  onto the
   other end of the dowel, making sure that the opening in the spacer is on the
   same side of the dowel as the two holes in the PDB.

6. Run the wire along the wood dowel; straighten it to remove twists. Insert the
   tinned ends of the wire into the holes in the PDB. It doesn't matter which
   wire goes into which hole. Use flush cutters to trim the wire ends protruding
   from  on the opposite side of the PDB. 







3. Run the wires along the length of the dowel. Solder the tinned ends of
   the wires to the switch; as before, trim the soldered wires using flush cutters.

4. Use zipties  to fasten the LED strips and the wiring to the dowel.
   The zipties should fit in the spaces between LEDs. The head of the
   zipties should be in the middle of the empty side of the dowel (without LEDs
   or wiring) - not at the corner! Place zipties every 7-8 cm or so.
   Tighten them (but not too tight, to prevent them from breaking) and trim.

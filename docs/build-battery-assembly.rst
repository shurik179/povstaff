Step 8: Battery and controller assembly
=======================================

1. Disconnect the batteries from the boards. Do not pull on the wires; instead, grab the
   plastic connector and pull it out (it takes some effort). Set the batteries
   aside for now.

2. Take the 3d printed spacers left in bag D. You should have one spacer that
   goes between the batteries, two spacers that go onto the ends of batteries, and 2
   small "plugs". Make sure you have them all.

3. Take QT Py microcontroller with the POV shield, a plug and one of end battery spacers.
   Assemble the together, putting the "plug" onto the board and then pushing
   the whole assembly into the spacer as shown below. Note: the "shelf" on the
   plug should be facing the white battery connector. Make sure to push it all the way in.

4. Repeat the same with the other spacer and plug and switch controller board.

5. Once you verified that everything fits, take it apart. Mix some epoxy glue
   and apply it to the outside of the plug (where it would be touching the inside
   of the spacer) and also on the bottom of the boards (again, where they would
   come in contact with the spacer). Assemble again; make sure the boards are
   fully inserted into the spacer and sit straight. If necessary, use electric
   tape or similar methods to keep the boards and plug in posiiton.  Put aside for one hour so
   that epoxy sets.

6. Once the epoxy sets,  insert the batteries (positive terminal first)
   into the spacers. Plug the
   battery leads into the connectros on boards. Carefully arrange the wires so
   that they run  along the battery through the openings in the spacers, with
   no wires crossing. Use 3/4" electric tape to attach the spacer to the battery,
   as shown below.  Make sure to apply the tape without any twists or kinks -
   otherwise, it will not fit into the tube. Do it with both batteries.

7. Finally, take mid-battery spacer. Insert the negative termianl of each battery
   into this spacer. **Warning**: only insert batteries from the end; do not try
   to force the batteries from top/bottom - you can break the spacer. Hide the
   slack of the wires into the spacer between the batteries, so the wires on
   the surface of the batteries is taut. Use electric tape to hold everything
   together as shown below.

8. Try inserting the whole assembly into the tube. It should go in, possibley
   with some friction, but it shouldn't require force. If it doesn't go in easily,
   try to locate  the offending place (usually some slack in the wires or kink
   in the electric tape) and fix it.

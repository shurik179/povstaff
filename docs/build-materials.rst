Tools and materials
===================

You will need the following materials:

* `Kit of parts <https://www.tindie.com/products/irobotics/pov-staff-kit/>`__ from
  my Tindie store, version 4.

*  **APA102/SK6982 (DotStar) LED strip, 144 LED/meter, black PCB**, for example
   this one `from Amazon <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BPX2KFD>`__. You need
   4 strips of 50cm (72 LEDs); you can also buy longer
   strips and cut them into 50cm pieces. The strips should not be waterproofed.

   **Important:** the order of signals on the LED  strip should be as shown below. If the order is different,
   the staff will not work! The BTF-LIGHTING strip at the amazon link above matches that requirement.

*  Two **18650 Li-Ion batteries**. Look for high-capacity (at least 3000mAh),
   **unprotected** batteries from a reputable manufacturer such as Panasonic, Samsung,
   or Sanyo. Do not try to save money by buying no-name battery on eBay or Amazon;
   instead, use a specialized  store such as `18650batterystore.com <http://18650batterystore.com>`__.

*  `Polycarbonate tube, 11F(55in/141cm) <https://flowtoys.com/long-tubes-5f-to-13f>`__,
   1 inch outer diameter, from flowtoys.com. Note: while the tube is listed as 55",
   the actual length is 54.5".

*  1/2 inch (or 12 mm) square **wood dowel**, from `HomeDepot <https://www.homedepot.com/p/Waddell-1-2-in-x-36-in-American-Basswood-Square-Dowel-8308U/100547367>`__
   or any other hardware store. You need two  pieces, each at least 52 cm (slightly over 20").

You will need the usual tools and supplies:

* wire strippers

* pliers

* flush cutters

* scissors

* decent soldering iron, solder, and flux

* sharp model knife or utility knife.

* fast-setting epoxy (I use `JB Weld Clearweld 5 minute epoxy <https://www.amazon.com/J-B-Weld-ClearWeld-Syringe-25mL/dp/B009EU5ZM0>`__)

You will also need a computer with WiFi  to upload the images  and a charger (either 5v charger with 5.5mm/2.1mm barrel jack connector, or a USB  charger and USB C cable) to charge the batteries.

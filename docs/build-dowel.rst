Step 1: Dowels
===============

Materials:

* two 1/2" square wood dowels

* Bag A from the kit, containing the power distribution boards (PDB),
  2x3 pin headers, 22AWG solid core wire,  and the press tool

* Spray paint, epoxy resin.


1. Take the two  1/2" square wood dowels. Use hacksaw to cut each of them to 52 cm length; try to
   keep the cuts square.

2. Spray paint each of them black. Let dry (you can work on the other steps
   while the dowels are drying).

3. Solder the 2x3 header to each PDB. Make sure to solder it on the correct side:
   the plastic spacer should be on the side labeled CHARGE (or SWITCH)

4. Use flash cutters to trim the 4 corner metal pins on the back size of each PDB,
   leaving the two middle ones intact:

5. Use the flash cutters to cut about 1 mm off the tip of the two remaining pins on the back
   at 45 degree angle,  creating sharp points.

6. Press the headers soldered to the PDB fully into the end of the dowel. Use the
   square drawing on the back for alignment with the dowel. The easiest way to
   do it is using the green press tool:

   Repeat the same with the other dowel and power distribution board.

7. Remove the PDB from the dowel. Mix some epoxy glue, apply it to the end of
   the dowel and replace the PDB seating it fully. Repeat with the second PDB
   and dowel. Be careful that no epoxy gets on the holes for wires.
   Leave for couple of hours to let the epoxy harden.

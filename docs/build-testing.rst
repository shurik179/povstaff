Step 7: Testing
===============================
Before continuing, let us do the final test. Make sure to clear large area on
your desk or floor for this step.

Take the controller assembly you had created in the previous step and plug it
into the LED assemblies as follows:

* The POV controller shield with the QT Py should be plugged into the LED assembly
  labeled CHARGE.


* The switch connector  board should be plugged into the LED assembly labeled SWITCH

**The LED assemblies are not interchangeable!**

In each case, the board must be plugged into PDB so that the label CHARGE (or SWITCH)
should be above the plugged board:

Double-check that everything is plugged correctly. Make sure that the switch at
the end of SWITCH LED assembly is in the middle (Off) position.

Now, take the batteries. Plug the battery connectors into the 2-pin JST XH
connectors on the POV shield board and the switch board (doesn't matter which battery goes into which board).

Turn the switch on (you will have to try both positions to figure out which of them is ON).

The staff should come to life and light up.

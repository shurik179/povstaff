Charging
===========
To charge the staff, turn it off by setting the switch in the OFF position.
You can charge using one of the following methods.

* Use a 5V power supply with 5.5mm OD/2.1mm ID barrel jack (center pin positive).
  Plug it into the connector at the charging end of the staff (opposite the switch).

* Alternatively, use the included USB C to 5.5mm barrel jack adapter and a USB C cable, plugged into a USB charger.
  Note: if using a USB C to USB C cable, many "smart" chargers (e.g. Apple macbook charger) will refuse to charge the staff as they require the connected device  to identify its capabilities. To avoid this problem, use a USB C to USB A cable.


Full charge should take about 5 hrs.

Step 5: finishing LED assemblies
======================

1. Mix some epoxy resin.

2. Take the two LED assemblies created in the previous steps. Peel off about
   1 cm of the LED strip (from the end farthest from the PDB), add epoxy
   underneath and put back. Repeat with all 4 LED strips. Use zipties to hold
   LED strips in place while the epoxy sets.

3. Straighten the wires that go from switch and charge connector to PDBs; push
   any slack inside the 3d printed spacer so that the part of the wire running
   along the dowel is taut. Add epoxy in 2-3 places  along the dowel to attach
   the wire to the dowel. Again, use zipties to hold wire in place.

4. Leave the LED assemblies aside for an hour until epoxy sets. After that,
   remove and discard the zipties.




This completes the construction of two LED assemblies.

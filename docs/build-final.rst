Step 10: Final assembly
===============================

Materials:
* LED assemblies, from previous steps

* battery and controller assembly, from step 9

* bag F:

  1.  two shrink wrap sleeves

  2. two foam sleeves

  3-4.  two 3d printed end protectors


  5. tennis grip tape

* Clear acrylic tube, from flowtoys.com

1. Make sure you have a large area to work.
   Lay out the LED assemblies, battery and electronics assembly. Make sure that
   the switch at the end of SWITCH led assembly is in middle (OFF) position.

2. Plug the battery assembly into the LED assemblies. As before, the side which
   contains QT Py MCU shoudl be plugged into the CHARGE LED assembly, and the
   other side, into the SWITCH LED assembly. In each case, the board must be
   plugged into PDB so that the label CHARGE (or SWITCH) should be above the
   plugged board:

3. Double-check that everything is plugged correctly. Do the final test: turn
   the switch on. The LEDs should briefly light up, showing the battery charge.
   If they don't, check the troubleshooting section.
   If everything is OK, turn the switch off and proceed.


4. Start inserting the whole assembly into the tube, CHARGE side first. Do it
   slowly. If you meet with resistance, push gently; if it is not enough, do
   not use excessive force - try to locate the problem. If necessary, remove
   from the tube and fix the wiring or electric tape. Watch that the LED assembly
   do not disconnect from the battery and elexctornics assembly.
   Continue until everything is fully in. Push to fully insert the switch; make
   sure the retaining tabs are inside the tube.
   If everything worked as expected, the charge connector should now be level with the
   opposite end of the tube or several millimeters inside the tube. In the
   latter case, use the included foam washers to fill the rest of the tube.

5. FIXME Cover the controller end of the tube with the PVC cap.

6. Take the other PVC cap; use scissors or model knife to cut a circle (about
   15mm) in it. Insert the switch spacer into the cap, with the angled side facing out.
   Use this assembly to cover the switch end of the tube. (The spacer prevent
   the switch from turning off  if you drop the staff.)

7. Apply the tennis overgrip tape over the middle part of the tube,
   containing the battery assembly and spacers -everything between the
   Power Distribution Boards. You can watch this video to see the proper
   way of applying the overgrip tape:

   between tape turns small - if you make them too large, your tape will run out
   before you reach the end of battery assembly.

===============================

Materials:
* LED assemblies, from previous steps

* battery and controller assembly, from step 9

* bag F:

  1.  two shrink wrap sleeves

  2. two foam sleeves

  3. Switch end protector

  4.  Charge  end protector

  5. tennis grip tape

* Clear acrylic tube, from flowtoys.com

1. Make sure you have a large area to work.
   Lay out the LED assemblies, battery and electronics assembly. Make sure that
   the switch at the end of SWITCH led assembly is in middle (OFF) position.

2. Plug the battery assembly into the LED assemblies. As before, the side which
   contains QT Py MCU shoudl be plugged into the CHARGE LED assembly, and the
   other side, into the SWITCH LED assembly. In each case, the board must be
   plugged into PDB so that the label CHARGE (or SWITCH) should be above the
   plugged board:

3. Double-check that everything is plugged correctly. Do the final test: turn
   the switch on. The LEDs should briefly light up, showing the battery charge.
   If they don't, check the troubleshooting section.
   If everything is OK, turn the switch off and proceed.


4. Start inserting the whole assembly into the tube, CHARGE side first. Do it
   slowly. If you meet with resistance, push gently; if it is not enough, do
   not use excessive force - try to locate the problem. If necessary, remove
   from the tube and fix the wiring or electric tape. Watch that the LED assembly
   do not disconnect from the battery and elexctornics assembly.
   Continue until everything is fully in. Push to fully insert the switch; make
   sure the retaining tabs are inside the tube.
   If everything worked as expected, the charge connector should now be level with the
   opposite end of the tube or several millimeters inside the tube. In the
   latter case, use the included foam washers to fill the rest of the tube.

5. Take the 3d printed switch end protector (item 3 in bag F, the one with larger
   opening). For shipping, it might have been placed inside the foam wrap;
   if so, remove it from the foam wrap.  Put it over the
   switch end of tube. There are two small bumps inside the protector which
   should go into the holes in hte tube; if necessary, turn the end protector
   until you hear the click.

6. Repeat the same with the charge switch protector (item 4 in the bag), putting it
   on the opposite end of the tube. Test the whole staff once again, turning it
   on and off.

7. Put the two pieces of the foam tube over the end protectors so that the foam
   tube extends beyond the protector by 2-3 mm.

8. Put the shirnk wrap over the foam as shown in the photo below. It should
   extend beyond the end of the foam wrap by another 5 mm

9. Use heat gun (on low setting) to tighten the shrink wrap.

10. Apply the tennis overgrip tape over the middle part of the tube,
    containing the battery and electroncis assembly  - everything between the
    ends of LED assemblies. You can watch this video to see the proper
    way of applying the overgrip tape:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNc34XlUBww. Make sure to keep the overlaps
    between tape turns small - if you make them too large, your tape will run out
    before you reach the end of battery assembly.

Step 5: Battery assembly
==========================
**Warning**: In this step, you will be soldering leads to Li-Ion batteries.
This could be dangerous if not done right! Please read all instructions
carefully and wear eye protection. You are working at your own risk!

Materials and tools used:

* Bag D from the kit

* Two 18650 Li-Ion batteries

* wire strippers

* Soldering Iron, solder, flux


1. Find the two 2-pin wires with XH connectors. In each of them, cut the **red** wire to the
   length of 3.5 cm (not including the connector). Strip about 5mm of the red wire and tin.

2. Solder the red lead of the 2-pin wire connector to positive  (+)
   terminal of each battery. Follow instructions on `this page <https://oscarliang.com/solder-li-ion-battery-18650/>`__
   for soldering. Tip: an easy way to keep the battery vertical while soldering
   is by using the clamp as shown in the photo below.

3. Turn the batteries over, with the negative  terminal up. Solder the black lead to negative
   terminal. 

Use voltmeter to
   check the voltage difference between the positive terminals of the two batteries.
   If it is more than 0.1V, find a low ommage resistor (1 Ohm or about);  press and hold
   it against the two positive terminals, to equalize the voltage.

7. Find the second battery wire harness with switch leads (uses red wire).

   Solder the two red leads to positive terminals of the batteries.  Make sure the direction they are
   pointing is same as the direction of the black leads on the negative terminal.


8. Arrange the two batteries in line, placing the spacer between them. (Use the
   spacer with partly covered top and bottom).
   Carefully straighten the wires  along the surface of the batteries,
   making sure they do not cross.  Use electric tape to temporarily attach the wires to the batteries.
   Make sure that the distance between each PDB and the
   battery allows you to insert the remaining spacers.

9. Take the piece of the large diameter shrink wrap and put it over the middle
   section of battery assembly. Push the batteries and spacer tightly together,
   being careful not to pinch any wires.
   Use the heat gun at low temperature setting  to shrink the large shrink
   wrap.

10. This completes the battery assembly. The side with long 2-wire leads is
    the **switch** side; the opposite side (with the bullet connector) is the
    **controller** side.

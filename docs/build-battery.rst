Step 5: Batteries
=================
**Warning**: In this step, you will be soldering leads to Li-Ion batteries.
This could be dangerous if not done right! Please read all instructions
carefully and wear eye protection. You are working at your own risk!

Materials and tools used:

* Bag D from the kit

  1. two 2-pin wires, with JST XH connector

  2. 3d printed spacer, to go between batteries

  3. Two 3d printed spacers to go at the ends of batteries

  4. 3d printed "plugs"

  5. 4-pin wire (22cm, 22AWG)

  6. Wire,  5.5 cm, 22 AWG



* Two 18650 Li-Ion batteries




1. Find the two 2-pin wires with XH connectors. In each of them, cut the **red** wire to the
   length of 3.5 cm (not including the connector). Strip about 5mm of the red wire and tin.

2. Solder the red lead of the 2-pin wire connector to positive  (+)
   terminal of each battery. Follow instructions on `this page <https://oscarliang.com/solder-li-ion-battery-18650/>`__
   for soldering. Tip: an easy way to keep the battery vertical while soldering
   is by using the clamp as shown in the photo below.

3. Turn the batteries over, with the negative  terminal up. Solder the black lead to negative
   terminal.

4. Repeat the previous steps with the second battery.

5. Take the short black wire and solder  it to negative terminals of both
   batteries as shown below. Take care not to desolder the previously soldered wires.

 6. Use voltmeter to check the voltage difference between the positive terminals
    of the two batteries. If it is more than 0.1V, find a low ommage resistor
    (1 Ohm or about);  insert it into positive terminals of the two battery
    connectors and leave for an hour to equalize the voltage.

Bag D also contains 3d printed spacers and 4-pin wire; they  will be used in
the following  steps.

========================
Materials and tools:

* Bag B from the kit

  1. 2-pin wire (55 cm, 24 AWG)

  2. 3d printed housing for charge connector

  3. Charge connector


* flush cutters, soldering iron

**Steps:**

1. Take the two-pin wire from bag B. Insert the ends of the wire into holes
   in the charge connector as shown below.
   **Important**: the wire with white stripe should be soldered to the shorter
   pin (this goes to the center pin, which is the positive contact).

2. Solder the wires. Use flush cutters to trim the soldered wires.

3. Insert the charge connector in the 3d printed spacer as shown below. Push
   against  a flat surface (e.g. the table) to make sure it is all the way in.

4. Take the LED assemblies created previously. Select the one with PDB labeled
   "CHARGE" (blue PDB). **Important: make sure you got the correct assembly!**
   Put the 3d printed spacer with charge connector onto the
   other end of the dowel, making sure that the opening in the spacer is on the
   same side of the dowel as the two holes in the PDB.

5. Run the wire along the wood dowel; straighten it to remove twists. Insert the
   tinned ends of the wire into the holes in the PDB. **The wire with white stripe
   should go into the hole labeled "5V".** Solder the wire and then trim the
   wire ends protruding on the other side.
